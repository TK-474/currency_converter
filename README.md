This is my first project that I made using RUST. 

It is a simple currency converter. Which uses the API from exchangerate-api.com.
The API key is capped at 1.5k calls per month so if the code is failing to execute that could be an issue.

Otherwise, the code works.
Inputs:
  1) Amount you want to current
  2) Currency you are converting from
  3) Currency you want to convert too
